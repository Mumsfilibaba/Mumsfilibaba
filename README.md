### Hello
My namn is Alexander, and I'm an Rendering Engineer. 
I like to explore the different graphics APIs out there (DirectX, Vulkan, and OpenGL). Therefore, I have created several projects to abstract the graphics APIs to make it easier to do graphics programming, which is where my main focus is. 
I love learning and read about new rendering techniques and try to implement them. Some rendering techniques I have played around with is:
* Tiled-Deferred Rendering (Tiled Light-Culling)
* Physically Based Rendering with Image-Based Lightning
* Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing (FXAA)
* Temporal Anti-Aliasing (TAA)
* Shadow Mapping ("Normal" and Variance Shadow Mapping)
* Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO)
* Parallax Mapping
* Tessellation
* Ray Tracing

If you are curious, I suggest you check out the following repositories:
* [__Current Personal Engine__](https://github.com/Mumsfilibaba/DXR-Project): This is a hobby engine where the focus is on abstracting D3D12. First started as a project for testing DirectX RayTracing (DXR) but has evolved into another hobby engine. In this engine I experiment with even more graphic techniques. SOme examples
* [__Another hobby engine__](https://github.com/Mumsfilibaba/Lambda) (Not currently in progress): A hobby engine built for Windows and macOS. It has not a significant focus on rendering techniques. Instead, its focus is on abstracting D3D12 and Vulkan into a common API, based a lot on D3D11 and making Vulkan work similarly. The best example is the immediate device context implemented in the Vulkan backend. Other features include a memory allocator for Vulkan device memory and dynamic uniform buffers when mapping memory to the CPU.
* [__Yet another hobby engine__](https://github.com/Mumsfilibaba/RayEngine) (Not currently in progress): An engine with support for D3D11, OpenGL, D3D12, and Vulkan. At the same time, it has support for Linux, Windows, and macOS. Also looked into an Android version.

I also like to know how things work, mainly C++, which is why I have written both my containers and math-library, mostly as a fun learning experience.

* [**Template Library**](https://github.com/Mumsfilibaba/Custom-Containers)
* [**Math Library**](https://github.com/Mumsfilibaba/Math): Includes multiple vectors- and matrix-types with SSE support.

**Other interesting projects:**
* [**Lambda Engine**](https://github.com/Mumsfilibaba/LambdaEngine): This ia a game engine built by a couple of friends and me. We later used this in a school project.
* [**3D programming project**](https://github.com/Mumsfilibaba/3D-Programming-Project): This is the project for a 3D programming course @ **BTH**
* [**3D programming III project**](https://github.com/TheoBerlin/VulkanBoys): This is a project for a more advanced 3D programming course @ **BTH**
* [**Game-engine architecture course**](https://github.com/Mumsfilibaba/GameEngineArchitectureCourse): This is a project for another class @ **BTH** I did with some friends where we implemented a couple of different memory allocators and an archiver.
