### Hello
My name is Alexander, and I'm currently studying a _Master of Science in Game and Software Engineering_ **@** Blekinge Tekniska HÃ¶gskola (**BTH**).

In my spare time I like to work-out, do some more programming and occasionally play some games.

I like to explore the different graphics APIs out there (DirectX, Vulkan, and OpenGL). Therefore, I have created several projects to abstract the APIs to make it easier to do graphics programming. 
If you are curious, I suggest you check out the following repositories:

* [Current Personal Engine](https://github.com/Mumsfilibaba/DXR-Project)
* [Another Personal Engine](https://github.com/Mumsfilibaba/Lambda) (Not currently in progress)
* [Another another Personal Engine](https://github.com/Mumsfilibaba/RayEngine) (Not currently in progress)

I also like to know how things work, mainly C++, which is why I have written both my own containers and math-library. I would not use them in production, but it is a fun learning experience (Or **not** dependending on how much you like to read C++ specifications ðŸ˜…). 

* [Custom Containers](https://github.com/Mumsfilibaba/Custom-Containers)
* [Math Library](https://github.com/Mumsfilibaba/Math)

**Other interesting projects:**
* [Lambda Engine](https://github.com/Mumsfilibaba/LambdaEngine) is a game engine built by me and a couple of friends, we later used this in a [school project](https://github.com/IbexOmega/CrazyCanvas).
* [3D programming project](https://github.com/Mumsfilibaba/3D-Programming-Project) is a project for a 3D programming course @ **BTH**
* [Game-engine architecture course](https://github.com/Mumsfilibaba/GameEngineArchitectureCourse) is a project for another course @ **BTH** I did with some friends were we implemented a couple of allocators and an archiver.
