### Hello
My name is Alexander, and I'm currently studying for a Master of Science in Game and Software Engineering @ Blekinge Tekniska HÃ¶gskola (BTH).

I like to work-out in my spare time, work on several hobby programming projects, and occasionally play some games.

I like to explore the different graphics APIs out there (DirectX, Vulkan, and OpenGL). Therefore, I have created several projects to abstract the graphics APIs to make it easier to do graphics programming, which is where my main focus is. 
I love learning and read about new rendering techniques and try to implement them. Some rendering techniques I have played around with is:
* Physically Based Rendering with Image Based Lightning
* FXAA
* Shadow Mapping ("Normal" and Variance Shadow Mapping)
* Parallax Mapping
* Tesselation
* RayTracing

If you are curious, I suggest you check out the following repositories:
* [Current Personal Engine](https://github.com/Mumsfilibaba/DXR-Project) - A hobby engine were focus is on abstracting D3D12. First started as a project for testing DirectX RayTracing (DXR) but has evolved to another hobby engine. Here I have implemented RayTraced Mirror reflections using DXR, but also variance shadow mapping and FXAA. 
* [Another Personal Engine](https://github.com/Mumsfilibaba/Lambda) (Not currently in progress) - It is built for Windows and macOS. It is not a significant focus on rendering techniques. Instead, it focuses on abstracting D3D12 and Vulkan into a common API, based a lot on D3D11 and making Vulkan work similarly. For example, an immediate devicecontext was implemented in Vulkan. Other features include a memory allocator for Vulkan device memory and the use of dynamic memory when mapping memory to the CPU. 
* [Another another Personal Engine](https://github.com/Mumsfilibaba/RayEngine) (Not currently in progress)

I also like to know how things work, mainly C++, which is why I have written both my own containers and math-library. Mostly as a fun learning experience (Or **not** dependending on how much you like to read C++ specifications ðŸ˜…). 

* [Custom Containers](https://github.com/Mumsfilibaba/Custom-Containers)
* [Math Library](https://github.com/Mumsfilibaba/Math) - Includes multiple vector- and matrix-types with SSE support.

**Other interesting projects:**
* [Lambda Engine](https://github.com/Mumsfilibaba/LambdaEngine) is a game engine built by me and a couple of friends, we later used this in a [school project](https://github.com/IbexOmega/CrazyCanvas).
* [3D programming project](https://github.com/Mumsfilibaba/3D-Programming-Project) is a project for a 3D programming course @ **BTH**
* [3D Programming III project](https://github.com/TheoBerlin/VulkanBoys) is a project for a 3D programming III course @ **BTH**
* [Game-engine architecture course](https://github.com/Mumsfilibaba/GameEngineArchitectureCourse) is a project for another course @ **BTH** I did with some friends were we implemented a couple of allocators and an archiver.
