### Hello
My name is Alexander, and I'm currently studying a Master of Science in Game and Software Engineering **@** Blekinge Tekniska HÃ¶gskola (**BTH**).

In my spare time I like to work-out, do some more programming and occasionally play some games.

I like to explore the different graphics APIs out there (DirectX, Vulkan, and OpenGL). Therefore, I have created several projects to abstract the APIs to make it easier to do graphics programming. 
If you are curious, I suggest you check out the following repositories:

I also like to know how things work, mainly C++, which is why I have written both my own containers and math-library. I would not use them in production, but it is a fun learning experience (Or **not** dependending on how much you like to read C++ specifications ðŸ˜…).
