### Hello There!
My name is Alexander, and I am a passionate software engineer specializing in graphics and rendering. Over the years, I have developed a keen interest in shader programming and lower-level graphics APIs such as DirectX 12, Vulkan, and Apple's Metal. This passion has driven me to create various projects that explore the world of graphics programming.

Here are some projects:
* [Hobby Engine](https://github.com/Mumsfilibaba/DXR-Project/tree/development): This is my personal rendering engine, serving as a playground for testing different rendering techniques and programming ideas. It features an abstraction layer that allows easy switching between DirectX 12 and Vulkan. Additionally, it incorporates a task system for multithreading and a modular design for better organization. The project began as an experiment with the DXR API and has evolved significantly since then.
* [CrazyCanvas](https://github.com/IbexOmega/CrazyCanvas): CrazyCanvas is a multiplayer first-person shooter developed from scratch during a course (PA2526) at Blekinge Institute of Technology. The game features unique gameplay where enemy players are only visible in reflections, utilizing Vulkan Ray Tracing. As part of a ten-member team, my primary responsibilities included implementing rendering techniques such as animation blending, meshlet rendering with mesh shaders, and Temporal Anti-Aliasing.
* [Vulkan PathTracer](https://github.com/Mumsfilibaba/Vulkan-Project/tree/Path-Tracer): This project is a simple yet powerful path tracer written in C++ and GLSL, leveraging both software and hardware-accelerated ray tracing. The focus was on building and optimizing Bounding Volume Hierarchies (BVH) using surface area heuristics (SAH) to enhance ray tracing efficiency.

Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you have any questions or collaboration ideas!
